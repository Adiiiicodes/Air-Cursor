# Welcome to FingerMagic! 🖐️✨

## What is FingerMagic?

FingerMagic is the result of combining cutting-edge technology with a touch of wizardry to create a magical experience where your fingers control the digital realm! It's like having a tiny sorcerer residing in your webcam, ready to interpret your hand gestures and turn them into computer commands!

## How does it work?

Using the power of Mediapipe and PyAutoGUI, FingerMagic tracks the movement of your index finger with the precision of a mystical oracle. Simply wave your finger in front of your webcam, and watch in amazement as your cursor dances across the screen as if guided by an unseen force!

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Cast your GitHub spell and clone this repository onto your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Brew your potion by installing the necessary ingredients with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Run the Spell**: Open your terminal and run `python finger_magic.py`. Don't forget to channel your inner wizard!

4. **Unleash the Magic**: Wave your finger and behold the wonders of FingerMagic as your cursor obeys your every gesture!
